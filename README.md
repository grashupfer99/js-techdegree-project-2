# Pagination & Content Filter
This project is implemented using the JavaScript Module Pattern. Depending on a total number of students, the app dynamically creates page links and displays 10(default value) students per page. 
The solution works for any number of student listings, whether there were 5, 25, 55 or 100 students listings. Additionally, a search bar function is used to allow users to search the list of students for a particular student or students.
